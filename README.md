This project allows users to register and verify their identity in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof manner using smart contracts.
## üöÄ Features
- User registration and login
- Secure identity verification
- Blockchain-based data storage
- MetaMask integration
- Simple frontend interface
## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (or whatever you used)
- **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ganache, Remix IDE
- **Wallet:** MetaMask
- **Backend (if any):** Node.js
## ‚ö° Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kyc-frontend.git
   cd kyc-frontend
How to Initialize and Run the Decentralized KYC Project
Set up Local Blockchain

Start Ganache on your machine to create a local Ethereum blockchain environment.

Configure MetaMask

Install MetaMask browser extension.

Connect MetaMask to the Ganache local network by adding Ganache's RPC URL as a custom network.

Import Ganache accounts into MetaMask using their private keys for testing.

Open Remix IDE

Go to remix-project.org.

Upload or create the Solidity smart contracts for the KYC system.

Compile Contracts

Use Remix IDE‚Äôs compiler to compile the smart contracts.

Deploy Smart Contracts

Set Remix‚Äôs environment to ‚ÄúInjected Web3‚Äù which connects to MetaMask and Ganache.

Deploy contracts via Remix and confirm the transactions in MetaMask.

Interact with the Contracts

Use Remix‚Äôs interface or the simple frontend to register users and verify identities using MetaMask-signed transactions.

Run Ganache from Command Prompt

You can launch or manage Ganache via command prompt where needed to monitor or control the local blockchain.
